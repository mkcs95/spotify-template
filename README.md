# spotify-template
This template is an optional starting point for a challenge for the following [course](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/) at the University of Washington.  The instructions are described [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/spotify).

What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
It gives a sample of a variety of songs based on a 3 or more character search. It returns album art as the primary return. 

What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Yes, I worked with my partner Rahul Banala after being given permission by the instructor.

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
This took approximately 8-10 hours

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
The problems we encountered are mainly based with retrieving album art and validation for search entries.
